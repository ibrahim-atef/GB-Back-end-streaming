React App Integration
Your React app will be the frontend that communicates with both backends (main API for user data, 
metadata, and authentication, and the streaming app for content).

Environment Configuration: Configure base URLs in your React app to route requests to the respective APIs
 based on the type of operation (e.g., /api/auth routes to the main API, while /api/content routes to
  the streaming app).
JWT Storage: Store JWT tokens securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies) and include them in requests 
from the React app to both APIs for verification.


Implement caching mechanisms and progressive loading on the client side for a smooth viewing experience.


Example Integration Flow
React App: User submits a form to upload new content.
Main API: React app sends metadata to the main API (e.g., title, type).
Main API: Returns a contentId.
React App: Uses the contentId and uploads the file via the streaming app.
Streaming App: Uploads to Cloudinary, saves the URL in its own DB, and then notifies the main API to update the metadata.
